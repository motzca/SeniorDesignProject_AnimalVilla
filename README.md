# Animal Villa

Animal Villa is an innovative mobile game developed by a dedicated team from the University of Cincinnati. This game merges the excitement of choose-your-own-adventure mechanics with the depth of role-playing, embedded with narratives reflecting the multifaceted realities of diverse social groups. Through engaging gameplay, Animal Villa aims to challenge societal disparities and biases, promoting empathy, understanding, and inclusivity within the gaming community.

## Introduction

In the digital realm of video gaming, which transcends geographical and cultural boundaries, Animal Villa stands as a beacon of change. Developed by a passionate team including Chloe Motz, Hetal Modi, Kelli Porter, and Ben Armour, the game seeks to navigate and challenge the disparities in representation of minority and marginalized communities, offering a platform that intertwines engaging gameplay with narratives that mirror real-life issues.

## Problem Statement

The gaming industry often neglects the fair and accurate representation of various social groups, perpetuating stereotypes and reducing empathy. Animal Villa addresses this by providing visibility and nuanced narratives beyond stereotypical portrayals, fostering a truly inclusive digital community.

## Solution

Animal Villa is designed to:
- Provide representation by featuring characters and storylines that authentically represent diverse social groups.
- Educate and sensitize players through immersive gameplay to the experiences of minority and marginalized communities.
- Encourage community interaction, leveraging the platform for dialogue and understanding of embedded real-world issues.

## Technical Elements

Developed using Unity, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Fungus, Animal Villa is designed with mobile devices in mind. The game employs the Scrum AGILE methodology, complemented by representation surveys and interviews for an inclusive development process.

## Installation

Currently, Animal Villa is in development, aimed for release on Android and iOS platforms. Installation details will be provided upon official release.

## Usage

Upon launch, players will navigate through the game by making choices that influence the story's outcome, managing in-game resources such as money, energy, and reputation to prevent game over scenarios, and forming meaningful relationships within the game's community.
